Python installation
To begin, you'll need to install the latest version of Python on your computer. Visit the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download and install the appropriate version for your operating system. Be sure to select the option to add Python to your system's path during the installation process.

Integrated development environment (IDE)
Although not strictly required, using an IDE can significantly enhance your coding experience. Popular Python IDEs include Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/), PyCharm ( https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), and Jupyter Notebook (https://jupyter.org/). Choose an IDE that best suits your preferences and install it on your system.
Package manager
Python's package manager, pip, allows you to easily install and manage libraries. Pip is typically included with Python installations (version 3.4 and later). To verify that pip is installed, open a command prompt or terminal window and enter the following command:
pip --version
If pip is not installed, follow the instructions on the official pip documentation (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) to install it.
